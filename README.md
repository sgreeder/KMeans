# KMeans
In this dataset I use many different skills such as a Decision Tree Classifier, Confusion Matrix, and KMeans Clustering. I am preforming KMeans Clustering on a movie data set using the number of users who voted for the movie, total Facebook likes for the cast, and the movie's Facebook likes. The K-Means clustering visualizes where each movie belongs in terms of relation to each other. I used 4 clusters because 2 and 3 clusters were too broad and didn't encompass all the outlying data well, and 5 clusters was too many. 4 clusters seemed to fit the data best. The confusion matrix had an accuracy of 67.97%.
